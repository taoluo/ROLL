# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

## Introduction

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a class of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning introduced by OpenAI in 2017. PPO strikes a balance between simplicity, stability, and performance, making it one of the most widely used algorithms in modern RL applications, including fine-tuning large-scale language models.

Traditional policy gradient methods (such as REINFORCE or Vanilla Policy Gradient) have the following issues:

1. High variance and poor sample efficiency
2. Instability due to large policy updates

PPO addresses these issues by using a clipped surrogate objective function that avoids overly large updates without requiring second-order derivatives.

## PPO Configuration Parameters

In ROLL, the configuration parameters for the PPO algorithm are as follows (`roll.pipeline.rlvr.rlvr_config.RLVRConfig`):

```yaml

## Key Components of PPO

1. **Actor-Critic Architecture**: PPO requires an actor model (policy) and a critic model (value function). This is different from algorithms like GRPO and RLOO that don't require a critic model.

2. **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**: PPO uses GAE to compute advantage values, which helps reduce variance in policy gradient estimates while maintaining low bias.

3. **Clipped Surrogate Objective Function**: The core of PPO is implemented through a clipped surrogate objective function that constrains policy updates.

## KL Divergence Control

PPO provides two mechanisms to prevent the policy from deviating too far from the reference policy:

1. **KL Loss** (GRPO approach, optional):
   - `use_kl_loss`: Whether to use KL loss in the actor
   - `kl_loss_coef`: Coefficient for KL loss
   - `kl_penalty`: KL penalty options

2. **KL Penalty in Rewards**:
   - A KL penalty term can be added to the reward function to control policy updates

## Dual-clip PPO

Dual-Clip PPO introduces a method that applies a lower bound to the policy ratio when the advantage is less than zero, preventing it from exceeding the specified lower bound when multiplied by a large ratio.

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Batch Size**: Adjust `rollout_batch_size` and related parameters according to GPU memory
2. **KL Control**: It is recommended to enable `use_kl_loss` and set an appropriate `kl_loss_coef` value (e.g., 0.001)
3. **Clipping Parameters**: `pg_clip` is typically set to 0.2 and can be adjusted according to specific tasks
4. **Advantage Estimation**: `whiten_advantages` is typically set to true to improve training stability
5. **Loss Aggregation Mode**: Different `loss_agg_mode` options can be tried to optimize training effectiveness
